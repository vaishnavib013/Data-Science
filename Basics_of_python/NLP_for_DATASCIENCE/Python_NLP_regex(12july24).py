Concentration of Risk: Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities,
restricted cash, accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds
or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of September 30, 2021
and December 31, 2020, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note
hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.
Concentration of Risk: Supply Risk
We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our
products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these
suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.'''

Note 1 - Overview
Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage
products. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines
against COVID-19, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions. On the other hand, infection
rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions and there are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic, including challenges
and increases in costs for logistics and supply chains, such as increased port congestion, intermittent supplier delays and a shortfall of semiconductor
supply. We have also previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to
administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments.

##Assignment Review

The market price of the book is Rs.200 but I bought it for Rs.150.
war is peace.
Freedom is slavery.
Ignorance is strength.
A beautiful novel by author George Orwell heloo hii.
We humans are gifted with most powerful mind but our human society develops on how we use it.
As human is gifted with emotions like love and care we humans also have emotions like greed and hatred.
This novels tells you all about it
