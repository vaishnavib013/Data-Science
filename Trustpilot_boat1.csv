1,I have bought boAt Rockerz 255 pro+â€¦,"I have bought boAt Rockerz 255 pro+ which always slips from my ear as one side is over weighted due to controllers.- Recently, the voice began to break in-between when watching videos. - Most of the times although it is connected to my device it is still saying ""YOuR deViCe iS rEaDy tO pAiR"".",Pavan Kumar
2,Received used product ,"I placed an order on August 16, 2024. It was supposed to be delivered on the 24th, but it wasn't. They gave me a 28-day delivery window, yet it still wasn't delivered. Finally, it arrived on August 30, 2024, but when I opened it, I found that it was a used product. I am very disappointed remanded to you do not purchase",Nisha
3,Return Problem,"I like the product of the boat. I bought an earbud from boat the sound quality was good but the buds stopped working after a few months for whatever reason. The boat has 1 one-year return policy, but they didn't exchange it even though I had an exchange or warranty card. For this reason, I am very disappointed by this company.",Aashish Sonar
4,Donâ€™t buy any product from boat brand,Donâ€™t buy any product from boat brand. Zero service they give to customer. Their product is just like their services. Not even working till 1 year. Avante bar 2050 I regret to purchased itâ€™s not working in just 6months. Your money will be wasted to purchase the boat product please donâ€™t even dare to buy. I regret to buy and wasted my money on this product . They donâ€™t even solve your query and not even replace the product if the product is in warranty and not even give the services. No follow up no calls from them about your problem they do nothing to solve your problem. you tired to calls mails and chats and frustrated and give up on the product if itâ€™s warranted and they tried them best to your warranty period just passed by just complaining and calling and not to quick solution and solve the problem. Worst experience ever in my life and my 7499 rs wasted. Because of their third class service. Never ever buy any product from boat. Please donâ€™t buy,Snehal Solanki
5,Very disappointed from the service ofâ€¦,"Very disappointed from the service of boat very poor , recommend not to buy product, I have purchased a product and it was broken so I asked to repair my product they answered that boat does not provide any kind of repair to your product if it is physically damaged although if you have warranty they will reject it Donâ€™t buy product because they donâ€™t provide any kind of good service  Boat company should understand by charging some amount of money also they need to repair the product they canâ€™t deniy for repair of product ",Meet Bhayani

7,Defective product delivered,"I ordered a neckband from Flipkart, but the product I received was in very poor condition. I requested an exchange twice, and although they processed the exchanges, each time I received a damaged product. When I complained for the third time, they finally acknowledged that the product was defective. In the end, I ended up wasting Rs. 1400.",Vini
8,Worst service & products,"Worst service & products. Order boat earphones in April 2024, started to have issue in June 2024, went to service center in thane called mayday. The executive was not bothered I providing solutions to customers, rather was curious for his lunch time. Send to some way or other to boat for servicing order was to be delivered on 1st August 24, but didn't receive. Got in touch with delivery partner about delivery they asking if u in so bad need of your product collect from warehouse. When inform boat service center about it they wanted 48 hrs to find a resolution on it. But after 72 hrs called them, they want again 24 hrs for their backend to react on it. Boat thinks that we customers are stupid & idiot. Their management should know that our time is more valuable than theirs because of us their company is running. If we stop purchasing their products then they will understand the importance of customer & rightly giving service to customers ",Farha P
9,Pathetic Customer service of Boat Lifestyle,"The customer service of this company is pathetic more than their products. I've boAt Rockerz 245 v2 Pro, it didn't even last for a month and one side stopped working. their customer service just make you wait for months and months until you get tired of approaching them. Escalations of a case means nothing to them",Deepak Goswami
10,BoAt makes Amazon delete any negative reviews!,"I ordered a pair of boAt 255+ pro Bluetooth earphones from Amazon after seeing so many positive reviews and when I actually used the product, it turns out that the ear piece is made out of cheap rubber which starts hurting your ear after 15-20 mins or so. Sound quality is quite subpar and it's just covered in lots of bass without any clarity. When I posted a review on Amazon, they deleted it saying that product sent to me was authentic and I can't write negative review. They didnt allow me to return the product either. It is such a big scam!",Dr. Pureview
11,Do not waste your money on buying boat products ,Do not waste your money on buying boat products. I bought headphone rockerz 450R. In 2 months it stopped charging/battery discharged in 30 minutes. On claiming warranty it was picked up from home but again delivered faulty (so called repaired) product. Again warranty is to be claimed.It seems a never ending process ,Ashwani Bansal
12,Please do not purchase any productsâ€¦,"Please do not purchase any products from Boat as they claim to not be responsible for any products after they have been dispatched. I received an empty box in my delivery package, so I advise against purchasing any products from Boat.",Ravi K
13,It's a waste buying boat products,It's a waste buying boat products. There is nothing called warranty service. If a product stops working its better to buy some other brand rather than spending effort on their service centre's.,Jasmine Mishra
14,1 year fake Warranty from boat,"My ticket number is 45191471 more than 15 days passed . Boat courier partner has stolen my airdopes and i got a msg that ""your product has been delivered on your address"",  but i didn't received nor i got any call or msg from boat.  5 days has been passed. No acknowledgement received through email. Customer Executive Just saying investigation is in progress but what is the exact status. When i get my airdopes back , No resolution provided by the team. I'm feeling like boat started the pick pocketing of their customers. Pathetic !!!",Vishnu Shukant Sudarshan
15,My bluetooth headphone had damageâ€¦,"My bluetooth headphone had damage inside so it was declared out of warranty.Rockerz trinity... I had given it for service along with the original box, so they removed its data cable also. Do not purchase from any boat company. They provide very third class quality items.",Naren More
16,Boat is the worst Bluetooth earphoneâ€¦,Boat is the worst Bluetooth earphone company. I have bought Boat Nirvana Ion recently on Feb 8 2024. Within two weeks itself the left bud stopped charging and I have claimed for warranty. Again after waiting for three weeks I have got a replacement product which stopped working after a month with the same charging issue. Boat Earphones are the worst product with no reliability and I would never recommend anyone to buy this useless product.,Devdath K.K.
